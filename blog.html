                <p>Despite originally scheduled to release this summer, Counter Strike 2 will apparently launch “soon” according to a recent Steam post.<br>
                    Counter Strike 2 is set to be “the largest technical leap forward in Counter Strike’s history” according to developers Valve. However, with fans expecting a summer release, it now seems they will have to wait a bit longer.<br>
                <span style="color: #000000;">COUNTER STRIKE 2 HAS HAS A JOURNEY</span> <br>
                In a Steam post celebrating the 20th anniversary of the site, Valve released an announcement about the future of the Counter Strike sequel.
“The year isn’t quite over,” the post began. “So far we’ve released a huge Steam Client update, Counter-Strike 2 entered into beta (and launches soon) and there are now more than 11,000 titles verified or playable on Steam Deck.”
It has been a long journey for the game after it was first announced in March of this year. Rumours swirled when a Nvidia driver update uncovered ‘csgo2.exe’ and ‘cs2.exe’ files but Valve neglected to comment.
Since then, the game was officially announced and Valve made sure to let fans know that it wasn’t a brand-new game but just a free upgrade for Global Offensive. <br>
<span style="color: #000000;">HOW SOON IS SOON</span><br>
As you can see, Valve were quite vague when it came to an official release date for Counter Strike 2. However, their statement could hint at an end-of-year release. Finger’s crossed. <br>
Despite an initial summer 2023 release date, CS2 was available in beta this March and saw many players happy with the direction the shooter was going. With the beta made available to anyone with a CSGO Prime account, it does make sense that the full game will launch very soon.
